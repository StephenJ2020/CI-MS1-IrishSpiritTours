# Irish Spirit Tours

Code Institute: User-Centric Front-End Development  
  
The Milestone 1 project assignment is to build a static front-end website using the technologies that we have learned so far on the Code Institute course.  
I have the option to choose from one of the following three scenarios or to come up with my own idea:  
. Build a website for a band (real or fictional)  
. Build a website for a gym  
. Build a personal portfolio site ( potentially for yourself) 
   
I have decided to create a website for a fictional tour company here in Ireland.  However, while the tour company is fictional the places featured  
are real and this was an idea that I had brought forward in September 2019 to the Celbridge Tourism and Heritage Forum, of which I'm a voluntary member.  
Over the last 5 years this voluntary community group has sought funding to produce [Celbridge Tourism and Heritage Strategy (2016-2020)](http://www.kildarelcdc.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Celbridge-Gateway-to-Irelands-AE-Tourism-Heritage-Strategy-May-2016.pdf),  
[Celbridge Heritage Trail Audio Guide](http://www.abartaheritage.ie/product/celbridge-heritage-trail-audio-guide/) and [The Discover Celbridge website](www.discovercelbridge.com/).  
While the group have not met since the end of 2019 and our activities have been suspended due to the Covid-19 Pandemic and the devastating effects it continues  
to have across the globe; it is hoped that we will be able to resume our work on future projects in late 2021 or early 2022.  
  
The idea for this tour came from the fact that the town of Celbridge, in Co. Kildare, has many historic and cultural sites that would appeal to the domestic  
and international tourism market, but also the realisation that our offering isn't yet developed enough to be able to  market Celbridge as a stand-alone   
tourist destination.  Therefore, my idea was to identify other coummunity groups in neighbouring counties who are also working to promote their local area  
and to collaborate to create a ready-made tour itinerary featuring each of our localities and to then pitch it at a number of local tour companies for one of  
them to take on and opperate.  The idea is not for any of the community groups or the individuals involed with them to directly benefit from this project.  
Rather the objective is for our wider communities to benefit from the impact that increased tourism will lead to i.e. increased private and public sector  
investment into improved facilities in these localities.  
  
For the purpose of my Milestone 1 project we're going to assume that the final tour itinerary has been agreed and that the fictional family run tour operator,  
Irish Spirit Tours, has undertaken to incorporate this itinerary into thier business as a means of expanding their current product offering.  
  
On that basis I have used the five planes of UX methodology to identify the user needs, the features required, the most logical way to structure the information  
and the functionality required in order to produce a wireframe that will form the blueprint for this Milestone project.
