                                                fun activities planned to introduce to your fellow tour companions while getting a taste of what our capitol city has to offer.

                                                    We'll meet in the hotel bar at 2pm and enjoy a complimentary glass of prosecco before heading out for a 3 hour walking food tour of
                                                    some of Dublin's hidden gems and of course a few old reliables.  We should be back at the hotel by 5:30pm and while we doubt you'll be
                                                    looking for a big dinner after having the delicious treats you will have sampled on the food tour, we will give you a few hours to rest and 
                                                    relax.  We'll re-group in the hotel reception area at 8pm and take a short transfer over to the Church Bar were we have an area reserved
                                                    for a private Whiskey Tasting hosted by Glen from Distilled Ireland.

                                                    The Whiskey Tasting event lasts approx. an hour and half, so at 10pm your tour leader will arrange the transfer back to the hotel, although
                                                    if some of you wish to sample a little more of Dublin's lively weekend nightlife then you can of cousre make your own way back to the 
                                                    hotel a <em>little</em> later.

                                                During this time your Tour Leader will do a brief Tour Induction and run through everything you need to know about this week-long

                                                    Upon arrival at Skerries Mills we will be met by our guide who will take us on a 50-minute tour that includes seeing the water 
                                                    wheel in action and the opportunity to try your hand at stone grinding flour.  We’ll also get to view inside both windmills and 
                                                    if weather conditions are right, they are both operational, which is an impressive sight to see.

                                                    After you’ve had a chance to browse the gift-shop we will board the coach to Ardgillian Castle, a short distance up the coast.  
                                                    The castle dates back to the 18th century and after our 1-hour guided tour you will have approx. an hour and a half of free time 
                                                    to explore the beautiful grounds of the demesne, take a stroll down to the stunning beach or to have a bite to eat in the café.

                                                    Around 2pm we make the short journey up the coast to the historic town of Drogheda on the banks of the river Boyne. We will visit 
                                                    Boyne Brewhouse and Boann Distillery, both owned by the Cooney family.  Here you are in for a special treat as not only will we have 
                                                    a guided tour of the Brewhouse & Distillery, you will also dine here with a sampler tray from the Brewhouse, followed with a Whiskey

                                                After breakfast we will board the coach and follow the Boyne River upstream to the site of The Battle of the Boyne, which was fought between William of Orange and James II 
                                                in July 1690. It was the last time two crowned kings of England, Scotland and Ireland faced each other on the battlefield. William of Orange won a crushing victory, which 
                                                secured the Protestant ascendancy in Ireland for generations.

                                                    At approx. 10:45am we will make our way to Listoke Distillery & Gin School where we will have a private Gin making lesson.  And guess what? At the end of the 2-hour session 
                                                    not only will you have produced your own blend of Gin but you get to take a bottle of it home with you!  After all your hard work distilling Gin we think you will have worked 
                                                    up an appetited, so we have arranged for the Distillery to lay-on one of the sumptuous lunches for us, consisting largely of local produce from the surrounding Boyne Valley.

                                                    optional activities for you to choose from so the afternoon and evening is yours to do as you please.  Although why not check-out our Add-On’s section which contains some of

                                                    making it older than Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids. At the end of the guided tour you’ll have 45 minutes free time to have a look around yourself or to grab a bite 
                                                    to eat in the canteen of the visitor centre.

                                                    In the afternoon we travel to the village of Slane, home to Slane Castle which has hosted some of Ireland’s most legendary outdoor concerts with bands such as The Rolling Stones, 
                                                    GUNS N’ ROSES and the Foo Fighters playing to crowds of upto 80,000.  However, in recent years Slane has also become home to Slane Distillery which is the next stop on our

                                                Our first stop today is at Mullagha Farm which is run by Michael and Jenny Finegan as a mixed farm, farming cattle, corn and 250 milking goats.  The goats are milked twice 
                                                a day all year-round providing milk for their cheese business.  Their award-winning Boyne Valley Blue is a semi-hard pasteurised blue veined goats’ cheese. It is the only one 
                                                made in Ireland and is even rare to find across Europe. It is matured for at least 3 months to acquire the correct blend of flavours.

                                                    Mid-morning, we will head to the town of Trim where we will meet our local tour guide for a guided tour of Trim Castle which dates back to the 12th Century and is surprisingly 
                                                    intact for its age!  While you will learn all about its fascinating history during the tour, here’s one fun fact we’ll share with you now, Trim Castle was heavily featured in 
                                                    the 1995 film Braveheart, which stared Mel Gibson.  After the tour you will have a few hours to explore the town of Trim or why not pop into one of the many great gastropubs 
                                                    for some traditional “pub grub”!

                                                <p>
                                                    While you are exploring, we will pre-check you into Trim Castle Hotel as we will be staying in Trim tonight.  The hotel overlooks the Castle and at night when the Castle is 
                                                    lit-up the views from the hotel are stunning.  At 6pm the group will meet up again in the hotel reception and we will make our way to the nearby Bru Brewery for a guided tour 
                                                    of yet another awarding craft brewery.  Tonight we will dine in the relaxed setting of the brewery, giving you the opportunity to sample a few more of their excellent beers.

                                                After a leisurely breakfast we will board our luxury min-coach once again and we will make the 45-minute journey through the rolling green hills of the beautiful Irish 
                                                countryside to the historic town of Celbridge, in neighbouring County Kildare.  Our first stop will be at the impressive Castletown House, which is a Palladian country house 
                                                built in 1722 for William Conolly, the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons.  It is often described as Ireland’s only true Palace!  During this you will start to see the 
                                                connection between some of the other sites that we have already visited on our tour and the intriguing and varied history of Ireland’s Ancient East will start to become a 
                                                little clearer to you.

                                                    Following our tour of Castletown House another local tour guide will meet us at the front steps of Castletown to take us on a very special 3-hour walking tour of Celbridge, 
                                                    so make sure you have your walking shoes on today!  However, don’t be worried as the distance covered is not huge, the ground is all flat and the tour is so enjoyable that you 
                                                    won’t even notice the time passing by. Plus, we will of course make lunch during the tour, but this is no ordinary lunch stop, we will visit the bar that now stands on the site 
                                                    of a former brewery, where the famous Arthur Guinness was born!  And what may surprise you is that not many people know that Arthur Guinness was born in Celbridge, and in-fact 
                                                    was laid to rest in Oughterard Cemetery on the outskirts of Celbridge.  Therefore, his birthplace is not overrun with bus loads of tourist everyday of the week and staff of the 
                                                    bar are more than happy to let you try your hand at pulling your own pint of “the Back Stuff”.

                                                <p>
                                                    After we’ve completed our walking tour, we will check-in to Celbridge Manor Hotel and you will have a little time to rest and freshen up before dinner.  Tonight, we will dine in 
                                                    one of the local restaurants in the heart of this delightful village.  Following our dinner, we have yet another treat in store for you, we’ve arranged for a late evening tour of 
                                                    the multi-award-winning Rye River Brewing Company which is also located in Celbridge. The team here are very proud of the reputation that they have worked hard to establish over 
                                                    recent years and these guys always want to out-do any of the other brewer tours, so we’re sure that they will pull-out all the stops to ensure that they are your favourite brewery 
                                                    tour!

                                                Our first stop today is at the Chocolate Factory of the luxury Irish chocolate brand Lilly O’Brien’s.  We will tour the factory, learn about the chocolate making process and 
                                                of course sample some of the delicious products.  We will also have the opportunity to craft and decorate some of our own chocolate creation which you then get to take home, 
                                                or if you are a Chocoholic, they might just about last until we are back on the coach!

                                                    From here we’ll head over to the Irish National Stud & Japanese Gardens.  Ireland is famed for the quality of our horses and The Irish National Stud is a Thoroughbred horse 
                                                    breeding facility in Tully, County Kildare, and some of the world’s finest racehorses have come from this stud. Following our Guided tour of the Stud you will have 2-hours to 
                                                    explore the Japanese Garden and the rest of the complex at your own pace and we highly recommend the on-site restaurant if you fancy a bite of lunch.

                                                    In the afternoon we will take the scenic route across the Wicklow Mountains on our way to Glendalough Distillery. Along the way we’ll make a few stops for some quick photo ops 
                                                    at locations you may recognise from several big budget Hollywood films that have been filmed in this area over the year, such as Braveheart and our favourite, PS I Love You! 
                                                    After our distillery tour and tasting session we’ll make our way to the sumptuous 5-star Druids Glen Hotel in time for our final group dinner!

                                                been a wonderful week-long tour.  This morning we will visit Glendalough Lakes.  We’ll meet our guide at the visitor centre and before touring the nearby monastic site.  You 
                                                then have the rest of the morning free to enjoy a stroll around the upper and lower lakes, for the more active a short hike to the nearby waterfall or if it’s one of our sunnier 
                                                days grab a coffee and chill by the lakeshore and soak up the natural beauty of this stunning area, which is often referred to as “The Garden of Ireland”.
