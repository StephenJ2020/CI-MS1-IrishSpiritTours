                    My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the tour, it has the perfect blend of Food, Culture & Craft Beer (and a few other very tasty local spirits! haha) 
                    Plus we took the option to extend our tour at the end to see a little more of Dublin and we were lucky enough that our dates coincided the Trinity
                    Summer Series of outdoor concerts - What a wonderful city centre venue for outdoor concerts!

                    Thank you Irish Spirit Tours for making my first trip to Ireland a turly magical experience - I will definitely be back again!
                    The tour is great and you visit so many beautiful places and I was surprised how much I really loved the food here (maybe I shouldn't say that but it's true). 
                    Plus I was so happy to meet many lovely people from many parts of Europe, we were all different ages but everyone was so friendly happy.

                <p>
                    I have been to Ireland before with work but this was my first holiday here. My work colleagues recommended I get out of the city and experience "real Ireland"
                    and I'm glad I did as that is exactly what my friends and I got on this tour. We are also very impressed with the quality of the local Breweries and distilleries
                    here. I highly recommend the Whiskey from the Slane Distillery, I brought a bottle home with me!
