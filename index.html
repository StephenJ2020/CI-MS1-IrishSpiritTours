            So why did I include my files at the bottom of the page but the CSS files at the top? Well, remember that when the browser opens our website, it interprets HTML from top to bottom. We want the CSS to be loaded as quickly as possible, so the user doesn't see an unstyled page. So for that reason, we place the CSS files at the top. Conversely, we don't want to prevent the user from seeing the content by including any large JavaScript files that might hold up the process. So for that reason, we place our JavaScript files at the bottom of the page, so they're only processed once all of the HTML and CSS has been loaded by the browser.
