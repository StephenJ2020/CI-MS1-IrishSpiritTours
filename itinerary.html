                                        some of Dublin's hidden gems and of course a few old reliables.  We should be back at the hotel by 5:30pm and while we doubt you'll be

                            some of Dublin's hidden gems and of course a few old reliables.  We should be back at the hotel by 5:30pm and while we doubt you'll be
                            looking for a big dinner have the delicious treats you will have sampled on the food tour, we will give you a few hours to rest and 
                            relax.  We'll re-group in the hotel reception area at 8pm and take a short transfer over to the Church Bar were we have an area reserved
                            for a private Whiskey Tasting hosted by Glen from Distilled Ireland.
                        </p>

                            The Whiskey Tasting event lasts approx. an hour and half, so at 10pm your tour leader will arrange the transfer back to the hotel, although
                            if some of you wish to sample a little more of Dublin's lively Saturday night nightlife then you can of cousre make your own way back to the 
                            hotel a <em>little</em> later.
